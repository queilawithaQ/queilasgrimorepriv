# Hacker's Grimoire

Hi. This is where I keep my penetration testing notes. It's a work in progress, updated as I learn new things. I also want to help others starting out in this field, so I'm including a lot of links to tutorials, books and lab sites that were helpful to me. [Read it on GitBook](https://vulp3cula.gitbook.io/hackers-grimoire/) or [fork my version](https://github.com/vulp3cula/hackers-grimoire) for your own use.

I hope you find it useful, [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hizeena) if you have any questions or comments! Please be gentle though, I'm just a noob helping other noobs :D
